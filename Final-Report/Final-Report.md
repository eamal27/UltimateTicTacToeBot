Introduction
--------------
Since the initial proposal, we put in time and effort in learning the languages, technologies and concepts that we had initially set out to achieve. After running into numerous difficulties and barriers, we changed the overall scope of the project, which we further detailed in our *Progress Report*. The new goal we set out for ourselves was creating an intelligent bot to play **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe** on [The Ai Games](http://theaigames.com/) [1] website. From our initial research we approached the problem by using a **minimax** algorithm, with alpha/beta pruning as an optimization.
